## 🌟 Features

- **Authentic Gameplay**: A faithful recreation of the 4,500-year-old Royal Game of Ur.
- **Dual AI Engine**:
  - **Cloud AI**: A high-performance Rust AI deployed on Cloudflare Workers for deep strategic analysis.
  - **Client AI**: The same core Rust AI logic is compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) and runs in the browser for offline play and instant responses.
- **PWA & Offline Ready**: Installable as a Progressive Web App with client-side AI for full offline gameplay.
- **Modern UI/UX**: A beautiful, responsive interface built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion animations.
- **Real-time Gameplay**: Smooth animations and real-time game state updates with immersive sound effects.
- **Celebration Effects**: Dynamic visual celebrations with screen shake, particle explosions, and triumphant sounds when pieces reach home.
- **Intuitive Controls**: AI pieces are non-interactive, preventing accidental clicks and ensuring clear game flow.
- **Detailed Game Analytics**: The AI provides detailed insights into its decision-making process.
- **Game Statistics**: Track your wins, losses, and win rate across all games played.

## 🎯 Game Rules

The Royal Game of Ur is a race game where each player tries to move all 7 of their pieces around the board and off the finish before their opponent.

- **Dice**: Roll 4 tetrahedral dice (binary dice). The number of marked corners facing up determines the number of squares you can move (0-4).
- **Movement**: Move pieces along your designated track from the start to the finish.
- **Combat**: Landing on a square occupied by an opponent's piece sends it back to the start. This does not apply to squares with a rosette.
- **Rosettes**: The starred squares are safe zones and grant an extra turn.
- **Winning**: The first player to move all 7 of their pieces off the board wins.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a unique dual-AI architecture, allowing the user to switch seamlessly between a powerful server-side AI and an instant client-side AI. The core AI logic is shared in the `worker/rust_ai_core` crate, ensuring consistent AI behavior across both platforms.

- **Client AI**: The same core Rust AI logic compiled to **WebAssembly (Wasm)** runs directly in the browser. It uses a deeper search, making it the **stronger** opponent. This also enables **offline play**. This is now the default AI.
- **Server AI**: A Rust AI on **Cloudflare Workers**. Due to the short compute time limits of serverless functions, this AI has a lower search depth, making it a faster but weaker opponent.

For a more detailed explanation of the architecture, please see the [Architecture Overview](./docs/architecture-overview.md) document.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **PWA**: Service Worker, Web App Manifest
- **AI Engine**: Rust (Cloudflare Worker) & Rust compiled to WebAssembly (Client)

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rgou-cloudflare
```

### 2. Local Development (with Database)

Follow these steps to get the game running locally, including saving data to the database. No advanced skills required!

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up the local database**
   - The game uses SQLite for local development. All your game data will be saved in a file called `local.db` in the project folder.
   - Run this command to create/update the database:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate:local
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   - The game will open at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is busy).
   - You can now play, and your game results will be saved to `local.db` automatically.

4. **(Optional) Inspect your data**
   - You can open `local.db` with any free SQLite browser (e.g. [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)).

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is designed for a seamless deployment experience to the Cloudflare ecosystem, leveraging OpenNext to adapt the Next.js application for Cloudflare Pages.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command uses the `@opennextjs/cloudflare` adapter to compile the Next.js application and package it into the `.open-next` directory, which is optimized for deployment on Cloudflare. This single command handles both the frontend application and the WebAssembly assets.

### Local Deployment from Your Machine

You can deploy the application directly from your local machine using the Cloudflare Wrangler CLI.

1.  **Ensure you are logged in to Wrangler:**
    ```bash
    npx wrangler login
    ```
2.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
3.  **Deploy the application:**
    ```bash
    npx wrangler deploy
    ```
    This command will upload the contents of the `.open-next` directory to Cloudflare Pages.

### Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions

Deployment is automated via a GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The workflow is triggered on every push to the `main` branch and performs the following steps:

1.  Checks out the code.
2.  Sets up Node.js and Rust environments.
3.  Installs dependencies.
4.  Builds the application using `npm run build`.
5.  Deploys to Cloudflare using the `wrangler-action`.

## 📚 Historical Context

The Royal Game of Ur dates back to 2600-2400 BCE and was discovered in the Royal Cemetery at Ur by Sir Leonard Woolley. The game's rules were deciphered from a cuneiform tablet by Irving Finkel at the British Museum.
