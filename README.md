## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** ([Download](https://nodejs.org/)) - Required for Next.js 15
- **Rust & Cargo** ([Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)) - For WebAssembly compilation
- **wasm-pack**: `cargo install wasm-pack --version 0.12.1 --locked` - For WASM builds

**Note**: This project was developed on an M1 Mac. While it should work on other platforms, some optimizations (especially for ML training) are specifically tuned for Apple Silicon.

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rgilks/rgou-cloudflare.git
cd rgou-cloudflare

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up local database
npm run db:setup

# Build WASM assets (required for AI to work)
npm run build:wasm-assets

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The game will open at http://localhost:3000

### First Run Notes

- The first run may take longer as it builds WebAssembly assets
- If you encounter WASM build issues, run: `npm run build:wasm-assets`
- For ML training, you'll need Rust and Apple Silicon Mac (see [AI-SYSTEM.md](./docs/AI-SYSTEM.md))

### Common Setup Issues

- **WASM Build Failures**: Ensure wasm-pack version 0.12.1 is installed
- **Database Issues**: Run `npm run db:setup` to set up local SQLite
- **Dependency Issues**: Try `npm run nuke` to reset the environment

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed solutions.

## 🤖 AI System

The project features two distinct AI opponents:

- **Classic AI**: Expectiminimax algorithm with evolved genetic parameters
- **ML AI**: Neural network trained through self-play
  - **EMM-Depth3**: **77.8% win rate** - **Best Overall Performance** ✅
  - **ML-Fast**: **63.9% win rate** - **Best ML Performance** ✅
  - **ML-V4**: **61.1% win rate** - **Strong ML Performance** ✅
  - **ML-Hybrid**: **61.1% win rate** - **Strong ML Performance** ✅

Both AIs run entirely in the browser via WebAssembly. See [AI-SYSTEM.md](./docs/AI-SYSTEM.md) for details.

**📊 Latest Performance Results**: For comprehensive AI comparison data, win rates, speed analysis, and recommendations, see [AI-MATRIX-RESULTS.md](./docs/AI-MATRIX-RESULTS.md).

## 🧠 Machine Learning

Train and improve the neural network AI with two training systems:

### 🚀 PyTorch Training (Recommended)

Fast GPU-accelerated training using PyTorch with Rust data generation:

```bash
# Install PyTorch dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Quick test (100 games, 10 epochs)
npm run train:pytorch:quick

# Standard training (1000 games, 50 epochs)
npm run train:pytorch

# Production training (2000 games, 100 epochs)
npm run train:pytorch:production
```

### 🦀 Rust Training (CPU Only)

Pure Rust training system with optimized CPU parallelization:

```bash
# Quick test (100 games, 10 epochs)
npm run train:rust:quick

# Standard training (1000 games, 50 epochs)
npm run train:rust

# Production training (2000 games, 100 epochs)
npm run train:rust:production
```

**Note**: PyTorch training requires GPU acceleration (CUDA or Apple Metal). Rust training works on any system but is slower.

## 🧬 Genetic Parameter Evolution

You can evolve and validate the genetic parameters for the classic AI:

```bash
# Evolve new genetic parameters (runs Rust evolution, saves to ml/data/genetic_params/evolved.json)
npm run evolve:genetic-params

# Validate evolved parameters against default (runs 100 games, prints win rates)
npm run validate:genetic-params
```

### Evolution Process

The evolution script uses a robust genetic algorithm with:

- **Population size:** 50 individuals
- **Generations:** 50 generations
- **Games per evaluation:** 100 games per individual
- **Post-evolution validation:** 1000 games to confirm improvement
- **Quality threshold:** Only saves parameters if they win >55% vs defaults

### Current Results (July 2025)

**Evolved Parameters Performance:**

- **Win rate vs defaults:** 61% (significant improvement)
- **Evolution time:** ~42 minutes
- **Validation confirmed:** 1000-game test showed 69.4% win rate

**Key Parameter Changes:**

- `win_score`: 10000 → 8354 (-1646)
- `finished_piece_value`: 1000 → 638 (-362)
- `position_weight`: 15 → 30 (+15)
- `rosette_control_bonus`: 40 → 61 (+21)
- `capture_bonus`: 35 → 49 (+14)

The evolved parameters significantly outperform the defaults and are now used in production.

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Run all tests (lint, type-check, unit tests, e2e tests)
