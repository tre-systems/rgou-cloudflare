# ML AI System

_Neural network AI implementation for the Royal Game of Ur._

## Overview

The ML AI is a neural network agent that learns to play by imitating the Classic AI (expectiminimax algorithm). It provides an alternative playstyle to traditional game theory approaches.

## Architecture

- **Input**: 150-dimensional feature vector representing game state
- **Model**: Two neural networks sharing input:
  - Value network: predicts expected outcome
  - Policy network: predicts best move (probability distribution)
- **Output**: Move with highest combined score (value + policy + bonuses)

## Model Structure

- Input: 150 features
- Hidden: 256 → 128 → 64 → 32 (ReLU activation)
- Output: Value (1 neuron, tanh), Policy (7 neurons, softmax)

## Current Performance

- **v2 Model**: **40% win rate vs Classic AI (EMM-3)** - **Best Performance** ✅
- **Fast Model**: 20% win rate vs Classic AI (EMM-3) - **Needs Improvement** ⚠️
- **v4 Model**: 20% win rate vs Classic AI (EMM-3) - **Needs Improvement** ⚠️
- **Hybrid Model**: 30% win rate vs Classic AI (EMM-3) - **Competitive**
- **Speed**: <1ms per move
- **Status**: v2 model still performs best, but all models need improvement vs EMM-4

## Move Selection

For each valid move:

1. Simulate the move
2. Extract features
3. Evaluate with both networks
4. Select move with highest combined score

## Why Use ML Instead of Search?

- **Speed**: Moves selected in milliseconds without deep search
- **Unique Playstyle**: Strategies learned from data, not hand-coded
- **Efficiency**: Runs efficiently in browser via WebAssembly
